Please focus on speed and resources. The solution should be able to handle input files with more than a billion URLs using limited resources (e.g., 1 CPU, 512MB RAM). Keep in mind that there is no limit on the execution time, but make sure you are utilizing the provided resources as much as possible at any time during the program execution. 

When complete, post your answer in a git repo and share it with the Recruiting Partner you're working with.
